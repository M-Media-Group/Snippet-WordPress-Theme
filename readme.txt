A simple theme for testing Snippet.

== Description ==

The Snippet theme is a WordPress theme designed off of the Gutenberg Starter Theme using our excellent and modern Snippet CSS framework.

The theme is primarily intended for use by those developing for and testing Snippet, but may also be helpful for those developing themes, or for folks who would like their site to look like Snippet in general. 

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I adjust theme settings? =

There are a few optional settings available in the `Appearance > Theme Options` panel added to WP-Admin. Each setting maps to a [theme support](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/theme-support/) option offered by Snippet:

- [**Dark background**](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/theme-support/#dark-backgrounds). Snippet provides some alternate UI colors, optimized for themes that use a dark background color. Turning this on will allow visitors who have dark mode enabled on their devices to see dark-mode colours on the front end.
- [**Block Styles**](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/theme-support/#default-block-styles). This option allows you to opt-in or out of having Snippet provide some structural CSS for certain blocks on the front end.
- [**Responsive embedded content**](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/theme-support/#responsive-embedded-content). When this is active, embed blocks will automatically reflect the aspect ratio of content that is embedded in an iFrame.
